Brainfuck Interpreter
=====================
One of my maths lecturers at Bristol University set us a task to answer what
is the sequence:
>+++++[<++>-]<+++ >++++[>+++<-]>[<++++>-] 
<.+< . >. < . >-> >
+++++>+< [ >[> >+>+< < <-] > > >[< < <+> > >-]< < < >[<+>-]
< < < <[>+> > > > >+< < < < < <-] >[<+>-] > >
[< <+> > > > >+< < <-] < <[> >+< <-]> > > > >.[-] 
< < < < < < < .  > > > > > > [<+>-]< < <-]
begining of.
Being a computer scientist i didn't bother to do it by hand and wrote the 
interpreter instead.

It is however missing the input ',' command.
